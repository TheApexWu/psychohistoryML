# Psychohistory-ML
**Predicting collapse and modeling social complexity through data science.**

This is a personal project of mine exploring the Seshat Global History Databank to test whether patterns in social complexity‚Äîpopulation, hierarchy, governance, and infrastructure‚Äîcan forecast civilizational collapse or resilience.  
I attempt to combine survival modeling, causal inference, and agent-based simulation in an open, non-commercial research setting.
